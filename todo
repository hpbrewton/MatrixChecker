Todo:
First thing is to solve for the number of dimensions for each variable
Convert all variables into SMT expressions
Convert all operations into SMT expressions
Execute SMT expressions
Find min unsatisfiable core
Map these variables back into the simple language operations

Feed back into positions in the program 
List of operations that need to be covered...
Come up with a way to recover from unknown functions
Support kwargs
Type check dimensions passed to array

Done:
Get all variables
Create definition of language for Numpy to output
Follow the tutorial on Numpy dispatch
